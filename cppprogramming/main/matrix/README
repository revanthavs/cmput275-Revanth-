	Exercise 4: Matrix Class
*/

INCLUDED FILES:-
Makefile
README
matrix.cpp
matrix.h

MAKEFILE TARGETS:-
1) make all
2) matrix: Builds the executable file
3) matrix.o: Compiles the matrix.cpp and create the object file matix.o
4) clean: Removes all object files and executables.

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:-
Once you are in the file directory just use the make command
make
Then the make will compile matix.cpp
and creates the object files for matix.cpp files
and then creates the excituable file by the object files
and the name of excituable file name is matrix
After using it if you want to clean the object files run
make clean

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS:-
1) Assuming that while the addition and subtraction operator overloading is called
the matrixs have the same dimentions
2) Considering that while the multiplication operator overloading is called the matrixs
have the following dimention (m x n).(n x k) = (m x k)
3) Assuming in the destrutor method to ignore the element at that index if
it's pointing to NULL
4) The bracket operator will returns the pointer of the row in the matrix
5) Assuming I can add public attributes and private attribute to the class
